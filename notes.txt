### models

user {
  id: ID //handled by the backend;
  username: string;
  name: string;
  calendars: [calendar]; //array of calendars user is part of
  events: [event] //array of events that user is part of
}

calendar {
  name: string //name of the calendar;
  users: [user]; //array of users subscribed to the calendar
  events: [event]; //list of calendar entries
}

event {
  name: string;
  date: Date; //date of the event
  creator: user //user that created the event (can delete or edit it)
  includes: [user] //array of users included in the event
}




the way it should work:
register (create user) > 
/login (known user is returned) > 
make a request to /calendars and return calendar(s) that have the user in the users field
